# CSS Cheatsheet

> ## A quick reference to the CSS properties.

You want to learn CSS or just want a quick refresher ? Having a proper cheat sheet will make your life a ton of easier.

Whether you’re savvy web developer or just a trying to experiment a little, feel free to use this CSS cheat sheet.

CSS syntax is comprehensive, and it is not easy to always know the exact syntax let alone all the available CSS properties and corresponding values. Thus I've created this quick reference guide that includes CSS syntax, the most important selectors, properties, sizes and units, and other useful CSS information in a short format.

I hope you'll find the CSS cheat sheet a valuable resource.

Note that I've tried to cover as many tags as possible but obviously there are a lot more things to cover and I highly encourage you to refer the MDN(Mozilla Development Network) CSS documentation for it.

All the style properties have been written in the file `style.css`
You may open the raw file to view the comments that describe each property.
