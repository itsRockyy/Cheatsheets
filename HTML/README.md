# HTML Cheatsheet

> ## A quick reference to the HTML syntax.

You want to learn HTML or just want a quick refresher ? Having a proper cheat sheet will make your life a ton of easier.

Whether you’re savvy web developer or just a trying to experiment a little, feel free to use this HTML cheat sheet.

### Following Group of tags are covered :

1.  Typography
2.  Lists
3.  Links
4.  Images
5.  Tables
6.  Forms
7.  Multimedia & ember

Note that I've tried to cover as many tags as possible but obviously there are even more lesser used tags which exist and I encourage you to refer the MDN(Mozilla Development Network) HTML documentation for it.

All the tags have been written in the file `index.html`
You may open the raw file to view the comments that describe each command.
