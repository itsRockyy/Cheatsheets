# Markdown Cheatsheet

> ## A quick reference to the Markdown syntax.

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of most Markdown syntax elements. Ofcourse it can't cover every single command out there but uses most popular ones.

All the commands have been written in the file `index.md`
You may open the raw file to view the comments that describe each command.

Please note that using Markdown doesn't mean that you can't also use HTML. You can add HTML tags to any Markdown file. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax.
