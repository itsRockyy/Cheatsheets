# Skeleton CSS Cheatsheet

> ## A quick reference to the Skeleton CSS properties.

Skeleton is the brainchild of Dave Gamache. It’s a twelve column, fluid grid, with a default max width of 960px, basic typography and minimum styles for common HTML elements such as buttons, links, inputs and textareas.

Its strength lies in the fact that it’s a light CSS framework.

Similar to frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, Skeleton also uses a mobile-first approach. However, as discussed, it doesn’t include the large number of components that those frameworks offer; it contains only some fundamental CSS rules that help you kick-start your development process.

All the style properties have been written in the file `index.html`
You may open the raw file to view the comments that describe each property.
